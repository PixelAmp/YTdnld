# YouTube Downloader!
This repo holds bookmark versions of my YouTube downloader script!

The work in progress versions of this script are held in a different (private) repository as I avoid breaking the things that already work ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

This will eventually be used in conjunction with a bunch of other scripts to make a nifty raspberry pi zero powered music player!

This project uses the pytube library to actually download the videos, all I did was add a nice little wrapper to make it useable

Send me a message if you have any suggestions for making this tool more useful!
