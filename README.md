# YoutTube Downloader!
This repo holds bookmark versions of my youtube downloader script!

The work in progress versions of this script are held in a different repository as I aviod breaking the things that already work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This will eventually be usied in conjunction with a bunch of other scripts to make a nifty raspberry pi zero powered music player!

This project uses the pytube library to actually download the vidoes, all I did was add a nice little wrapper to make it useable
